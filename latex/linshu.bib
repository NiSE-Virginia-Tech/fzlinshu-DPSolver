abstract="The addition of symmetry breaking constraints is one of the most successful symmetry breaking technique for constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). In this paper we present STAB, a method that adds some symmetry breaking constraints during the search for solution. STAB adds constraints that are not yet broken by the current partial assignment. The computation of those additional constraints require the computation of graph isomorphism at each node. Graph isomorphism is not know to be NP complete, and in practice can be solved quite efficiently using an auxiliary CSP. The method is refined to be applied to matrix problems where rows and columns can be permuted. A theoretical comparison with previously published methods shows how to combine those methods together safely. An experimental comparison on a class of highly symmetrical combinatorial problems, namely BIBD shows that STAB is more than one order of magnitude more efficient than best published techniques so far.",

abstract = "Publisher Summary
This chapter reviews that symmetry in constraints has always been important but in recent years has become a major research area in its own right. A key problem in constraint programming has long been recognised: search can revisit equivalent states over and over again. In principle this problem has been solved, with a number of different techniques. It discusses that research remains active for two reasons. First, there are many difficulties in the practical application of the techniques that are known for symmetry exclusion, and overcoming these remain important research problems. Second, the successes achieved in the area so far have encouraged researchers to find new ways to exploit symmetry. The chapter covers both these issues, and the details of the symmetry exclusion methods that have been conceived. It also explores the most important application of symmetry in constraint programming to reduce search: âsymmetry breakingâ. The goal of symmetry breaking is never to explore two search states which are symmetric to each other, as the result in both cases must be the same."
